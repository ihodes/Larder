# What *is* this?

Larder is a simple way to store ingredients you have on hand, construct shopping lists, store recipes, and track how much everything costs. To be sure, this readme will become eminently more readable in the future. 

# How do I use this?

You don't. Unless you're very adventurous and want to add your own code. For now, this is quite simple.

# DONE
__parse in a larderfile__
__calculate the price of a shopping cart__

# TODO
__unit equalities__
*needs to take place across all operations*
need to improve the unit system, allow for conversion between units
e.g. 16 oz == 1 lb
handle plurals: e.g. make oz==ozs

__recipes__
maintain a file of recipes 
can be picked, added to shopping list
can see price of a recipe

__tags__
e.g. in itemlist [organic, traderjoes]
then when creating a shopping list you can specify 
enables homing in on price, etc

__nutritional info__
maintained in larderfile (or another file?)
automated? (dl from a source?)
allows you to see info for particular items, or recipes
need to define syntax for this...
