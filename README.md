# What *is* this?

Larder is a simple way to store ingredients you have on hand, construct shopping lists, store recipes, and track how much everything costs. To be sure, this readme will become eminently more readable in the future. 

# Deps
[PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org) is the only dependency so far. It's quite easy to install, and an excellent piece of software.

# How do I use this?

You don't. Unless you're very adventurous and want to add your own code. For now, this is quite simple.

# DONE
1. parse in a larderfile

2. calculate the price of a shopping cart

3. unit conversions built in

4. prints rationals for precise numbers
