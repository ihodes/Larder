# What *is* this?

Larder is a simple way to store ingredients you have on hand, construct shopping lists, store recipes, and track how much everything costs. To be sure, this readme will become eminently more readable in the future. 

# How do I use this?

You don't. Unless you're very adventurous and want to add your own code. For now, this is quite simple.

# DONE
1. parse in a larderfile

2. calculate the price of a shopping cart

3. unit conversions built in

4. prints rationals for precise numbers

# TODO

__nutritional info__

__interactive mode__

__config file__
